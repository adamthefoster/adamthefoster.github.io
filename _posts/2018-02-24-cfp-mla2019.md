title: 'CfP: Critical Catalog Constructions (MLA 2019)'
---
The MLA Bibliography and Scholarly Editing Forum and the Libraries and Research Forum seek proposals for a collaborative session on Critical Catalog Constructions for the 2019 MLA Convention.

The panel will explore the use of and issues inherent to book catalogs (broadly conceived) as platforms for collaboration and as sources of research data that can potentially uncover patterns of book production and offer new insights into the sociology of texts. <!--excerpt-->As new research methods make use of this data, we must also consider the catalog’s trajectories of creation and utility.

Topics might include:
* How research practices have both informed and been informed by catalogs since their inception and how the work of bibliography is reimagined in the catalog
* How digital uses of catalogs currently enable mindful interrogation of catalog data and catalog making as well as possibilities for expanded use of rare book catalog data in the future
* Catalogs as digital humanities projects that invite reassessment of legacy information architecture as well as the many hands that built the bibliographic structures on which so much of the work of the digital humanities rests
* Understanding the historical context, cultural biases, technical and other artifacts inherent to catalogs
* Rethinking our understanding of the catalog “reader” and considering the computer as reader
* Speculative Catalogs; or, how might we achieve points of access that facilitate active reframing and interrogation of our collections by “readers”
* Teaching bibliography/history of the book through the catalog

250-word abstracts by March 15 to [dchildress@library.ucla.edu](mailto:dchildress@library.ucla.edu).
