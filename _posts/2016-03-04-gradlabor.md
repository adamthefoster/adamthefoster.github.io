From the website: "Libraries have an increasingly prominent role in the production of digital humanities scholarship through centers, programs, initiatives, and more. As leading scholars in the field like Bethany Nowviskie have repeatedly argued, getting graduate students involved in this work is essential for the future of digital work in the academy, and for the career success of 21st century scholars.[1] <!--excerpt-->Graduate students represent valuable members of digital humanities teams in a variety of institutional and library settings. They collaborate with scholars in labs, as members of project teams, as fellows, interns, instructors, research assistants, principal investigators, and everything in between. [...] This workshop will address how libraries and digital humanities organizations can make an ethic of care the foundation upon which their graduate student labor arrangements are built as they look to expand capacity within their institutions and beyond."
