title: Mapping Maupassant's Bel-Ami
---

Mapping Maupassant’s Bel-Ami is a collaborative project developed in the advanced undergraduate course, FR453Y: La Belle Epoque: Société et Culture en France de 1800 à 1914, taught by Dr. Willa Z. Silverman at Penn State University. This project is an example of literary cartography, following the example of similar projects, such as “[Mapping St. Petersburg: Experiments in Literary Cartography](http://www.mappingpetersburg.org/site/)” and “[Mapping Mrs. Dalloway](http://mrsdallowaymappingproject.weebly.com)." 
<!--excerpt-->
The [first iteration](https://humanitieslab.psu.edu/projects/mappingbelami/) of the project took place in Fall 2012 and was built using a self-hosted Wordpress site and the [Leaflet Maps Marker plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leaflet-maps-marker/). A second layer was added to the original site in Fall of 2014.

We are currently working on a new framework for the project using web standards and hosted with GitHub Pages. The [framework prototype](http://dawnchildress.com/literaryparis/) is up and running and the source code for the new site and the for the app running the framework can be found in the [literaryparis](https://github.com/kirschbombe/literaryparis) and [mapsandtexts](https://github.com/kirschbombe/mapsandtexts) GitHub repos.
