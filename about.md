title: About
---

I am a Humanities Librarian and the Sally W. Kalin Librarian for Technological Innovation at Penn State Libraries, where I serve as liaison to the departments of German and Slavic languages and literatures, French and Francophone studies, Comparative literature, and Philosophy. I also regularly consult and collaborate with faculty and students on projects related to digital scholarship and pedagogy. My background is in German literature, philosophy, book history, and textual studies. When I'm not occupied with the above or tinkering with things digital, I enjoy printmaking and translating German poetry.
