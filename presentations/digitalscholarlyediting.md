#Digital scholarly editing: a brief tour or practices, projects, and resources.


> _…the digital “critical representation” of any work “does not accurately (so to speak) mirror its object; it consciously (so to speak) deforms its object… [opening] the doors of perception toward new opportunities and points of view.”_ --Jerome McGann (_Radiant Textuality_)

###Editorial rationales
Let's first consider a few historical approaches to scholarly editing:

  * Literal: documentary editing
  * Intentionalist (Bowers): idea of the copy-text and the eclectic text (readings drawn from multiple witnesses)
  * Genetic: more inclusive, pre-publication versions (French school), also Genette's paratext (that which sits outside the main text)
  * Social text (McGann): critical of intentionalist editing; texts are social, historically situated, as are the author's intentions (enter versioning)

_A few example projects_
* Chymistry of Isaac Newton:  _note the use of normalized vs. diplomatic transcriptions_

* Lowell's "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO”:  _note the presentation of multiple witnesses in one eclectic text using TEI's parallel segmentation_

* Shelly-Godwin Archive:  _note the choice of views, Mary Shelley’s hand or Percy Shelley’s hand_

* Petrus Plaoul: _requires login, but the Index will get you access to some of the text. click on the “Paragraph Menu” at the end of a paragraph and try some of the “Comparison Tools”.
