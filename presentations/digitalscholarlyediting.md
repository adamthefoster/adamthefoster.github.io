###...a brief tour or practices, projects, and reources.


> …the digital “critical representation” of any work “does not accurately (so to speak) mirror its object; it consciously (so to speak) deforms its object… [opening] the doors of perception toward new opportunities and points of view.”  --Jerome McGann (_Radiant Textuality_)

###Editorial rationales
Let's first consider a few historical approaches to scholarly editing:
*Literal: documentary editing
*Intentionalist (Bowers): idea of the copy-text and the eclectic text (readings drawn from multiple witnesses)
*Genetic: more inclusive, pre-publication versions (French school), also Genette's paratext (that which sits outside the main text)
*Social text (McGann): critical of intentionalist editing; texts are social, historically situated, as are the author's intentions (enter versioning)

In many cases, digital scholarly editing attempts to recreate the editorial rationales
