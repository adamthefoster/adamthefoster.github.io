#Digital scholarly editing: a brief tour or practices, projects, and resources.


> _…the digital “critical representation” of any work “does not accurately (so to speak) mirror its object; it consciously (so to speak) deforms its object… [opening] the doors of perception toward new opportunities and points of view.”_ --Jerome McGann (_Radiant Textuality_)

###Editorial rationales
Let's first consider a few historical approaches to scholarly editing:

  * Literal: documentary editing
  * Intentionalist (Bowers): idea of the copy-text and the eclectic text (readings drawn from multiple witnesses)
  * Genetic: more inclusive, pre-publication versions (French school), also Genette's paratext (that which sits outside the main text)
  * Social text (McGann): critical of intentionalist editing; texts are social, historically situated, as are the author's intentions (enter versioning)

In many cases, digital scholarly editing attempts to recreate the rationales of these and other editorial practices, taking advantage of the digital for markup and presentation of the text structure / organization and to tag / annotate contextual info like people, places, events, and dates; to give context using links, metadata, and encoded editorial notes; to make interactive with hypertext, hovers and pop-ups for editorial info, user selected views, etc.), and for collation and versioning to compare and analyze texts.

_A few example projects_

* [Chymistry of Isaac Newton](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/browse;jsessionid=47908DE72B75BAEFFA1E3A83BA29858D):  _Note the use of normalized vs. diplomatic transcriptions._ 
* [Lowell's "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO”](http://www.scholarlyediting.org/2015/editions/lowelledition_wit-Courier.html):  _Note the presentation of multiple witnesses in one eclectic text using TEI's parallel segmentation._ 
* [Shelly-Godwin Archive](http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/oxford/frankenstein/notebook/a#/p11):  _Note the choice of views, Mary Shelley’s hand or Percy Shelley’s hand._ 
* [Petrus Plaoul](http://petrusplaoul.org/indexsearch/displayindexsearch.php?index=name&type=Classical&name=Anaxagoras): _Requires login, but the Index will get you access to some of the text. click on the “Paragraph Menu” at the end of a paragraph and try some of the “Comparison Tools”._ 
* [Selected Poems by the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven](http://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/poem?pid=umd:55435): _Example of the Versioning Machine_
